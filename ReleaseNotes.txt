Release 1.2.0 - 17 Jan 2016
===========================================================================

Mantle Business Artifacts 1.2.0 is a major new feature and bug fix release.

This release is based on Moqui Framework 1.6.0.

There are over 740 commits since the last release and an increase in size
from around 40k lines to around 48k lines of text (primarily XML, Groovy,
and FTL files). Over 5k lines were moved to the SimpleScreens project
(report and printed doc templates, MyAccount app). Mantle has 338 entities
(plus 154 view entities), and 481 services (118 new since last release).

Mantle is focused on being a low-level business artifacts library, in other
words data model and logic but no user interface. The My Account app and
the various templates in the mantle-usl component have been moved to the
new SimpleScreens project, making Mantle more focused on this objective.
Another improvement in this direction is a well organized remotely
accessible API using the new Service REST feature in Moqui Framework.

The new Mantle REST API has 352 services. This API can be viewed and
services called through the Swagger UI with links from the Moqui Tools app.
The REST API is not only useful for remote access by dynamic web apps and
mobile or desktop client applications, but also as a reference for the
services and entities to use for common business operations.

One major area that was missing in previous releases was return processing,
and this release includes that functionality with an enhanced data model,
services for general return processing, and automated tests.

There are many advanced new features including: EDI (X12 Rec 850, Send 855,
Send 856, Send 810, and Send/Rec 997); OFX import and reconcile; NACHA
export; positive pay export for a few banks; Cash Flow Statement,
Retained Equity Statement, and Financial Ratios report services; and the
AuthorizeDotNet component is now part of Mantle.

There are also many basic accounting enhancements with improved demo GL
structure, better handling of invoice and payment cancel/void/change,
and services to adjust an invoice and post the adjustment to the GL. There
is also now GL posting for physical inventory variance, WIP inventory, and
improved period closing and time period handling. Overall the accounting
functionality is refined and more complete to handle common business needs.

With this release Mantle Business Artifacts is now a comprehensive
foundation for ERP systems.

Non Backward Compatible Changes

- Removed the MyAccount screens, now in the SimpleScreens project
- Removed the template directory, now in the SimpleScreens project (can
  search for component://mantle-usl/template and replace with
  component://SimpleScreens/template)
- The Payment.paymentMethodTypeEnumId field is replaced with the
  paymentInstrumentEnumId field; PaymentMethodType enums are simplified to
  represent only the various types of PaymentMethod records, and the actual
  instrument used for a Payment by the new paymentInstrumentEnumId
- The PaymentMethodTypeGlAccount is replaced by PaymentInstrumentGlAccount
  corresponding with the Payment.paymentMethodTypeEnumId field replacement
  by Payment.paymentInstrumentEnumId

  middleNameOnAccount, lastNameOnAccount, suffixOnAccount,
  companyNameOnAccount)
- GlAccountType enumeration keys have been changed to camel case to
  eliminate redundancy and demo GL Account data and code updated; for
  existing systems th gl accounts demo data will need to be reloaded, all
  AcctgTransEntry.glAccountTypeEnumId values updated, and old GlAccountType
  Enumeration records removed; no known systems using this in production so
  no automation is in place to do this.

  contact mechanisms are associated with each OrderPart instead of header

  with each OrderPart instead of header
